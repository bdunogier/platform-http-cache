# platform-http-cache

Provides HTTP cache handling for [eZ Platform][ezplatform], by default since version 1.12. From [ezpublish-kernel](ezpublish-kernel),
it adds support for mult-tagging for Symfony Proxy, Varnish _(using [xkey][Varnish-xkey])_. Support for Fastly is part of the
eZ Platform Cloud Enterprise offer as of 1.13 LTS.

## Enabling the package on versions prior to 1.12
1. Add the package to `app/AppKernel.php`, *before* `EzPublishCoreBundle`, but after `FOSHttpCacheBundle`:

```php
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...
            new FOS\HttpCacheBundle\FOSHttpCacheBundle(),
            new EzSystems\PlatformHttpCacheBundle\EzSystemsPlatformHttpCacheBundle(),
            new eZ\Bundle\EzPublishCoreBundle\EzPublishCoreBundle(),
            // ...
        );
```

The package will replace several services from the kernel, thus enabling the new features, such as multi-tagging.

2. The application cache class needs to be customized. This is done by modifying `AppCache` class, you will have to make
it extend `EzSystems\PlatformHttpCacheBundle\AppCache`.

Do not forget to restart your web server.

## Usage with Varnish

For usage with Varnish see the dedicated document in [docs/varnish](docs/varnish/varnish.md)


## Features

### `xkey` header on ContentView responses
Responses from `/content/view` will be tagged based on their contents:

```
curl -i -X HEAD 'http://localhost:8000/'

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Host: localhost:8000
Connection: close
Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=60
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Vary: Cookie
Vary: Authorization
xkey: content-1
xkey: content-type-1
xkey: location-2
xkey: parent-1
xkey: path-1
xkey: path-2
```

### Toggling of cache on ContentView responses
Responses from `/content/view` will be made cachable, and the shared max age will be set if it is enabled.

### Purging of tagged HTTP cache on Repository operations
A set of Slots will send HTTP PURGE requests for each cache tag affected by write operations. 


## Configuration

### Drivers

This bundle lets you configure drivers for handling HTTP cache. The following exists from eZ:
- `local`: extended Symfony Proxy to support tagging and varying by user rights _(available in this bundle)_
- `http` aka `varnish`: Varnish proxy using and customizing FosHttpCache for purging _(available in this bundle)_
- `fastly`: Fastly CDN proxy _(available with eZ Platform Enterprise and documented separately)_


Configuring these is done using global `ezpublish.http_cache.purge_type` config. By default it is set to use
`%purge_type%` parameter, and can be set in `app/config/parameters.yml` like so:

```
parameters:
    purge_type: varnish
```

For further reading on drivers see [docs/drivers.md](docs/drivers.md).
